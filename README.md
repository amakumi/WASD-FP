## ticket<b>maya</b>.me
This is the front end repository for the website ticketmaya.me. 

## Front-End

Our front end uses Angular Framework for single-paged design. This enables fluid page transitions between pages with minimal load times during page navigation.
There are several plugins we implemented to enhance the experience in using this site, to name a few:
* Carousel by OWL Carousel
* Angular Material
* Bootstrap
* Templates published in StartBootstrap and Colorlib with modifications.
* Browser Animation by AOS
* Countdown Timer supported by Ngx Countdown

*All rights reserved to their respective owners.*

## Features

* Easily Signup and Login to create an account
* Verify your email
* Create events by supplying relevant data and a poster
* Manage the event by downloading list of attendees and getting payment proofs in one click
* Easily share the event-page by sharing the event-id
* Upload proof of payment easily, an email with instructions and link to upload the proof is sent after purchasing an event.

## Optimizations

While most of the website is eagerly loaded, the ADMIN routes are lazy loaded since not everyone can access it.

## Website Design

We incorporate the integration of Bootstrap, Angular Material, along with our own design language to craft and develop the design language of this website. 
The templates that we implemented are listed on the section below:
